# Impact-force-identification-using-DL-and-ABC-SS
This repository contains datasets for identifying impact forces in pipeline segments made of aluminum, plastic, and rubber. The data is used in combination with machine learning techniques and approximate Bayesian computing with subsets.

The dataset includes information from four different segments of a pipeline, with impact data recorded at 11 distinct angles along the cross-section of each segment. The angles are as follows:

0.0°, 20.5°, 41.0°, 61.5°, 82.0°, 98.5°, 115.0°, 135.5°, 156.0°, 176.5°, and 197.0°

At each angle, impacts occur at various locations along the pipeline's depth. The dataset is organized into three material types (aluminum, plastic, and rubber), and each material dataset contains:

Time (s)
Impact Force (N)
Acceleration Sensor 1 Response (g)
Acceleration Sensor 2 Response (g)
Acceleration Sensor 3 Response (g)
Acceleration Sensor 4 Response (g)
These datasets can be used to study the effects of impacts at different angles and across different materials. This repository does not include analysis code, but the data is formatted for easy use in machine learning models, impact identification algorithms, and structural health monitoring studies.
